This repository is mainly for projects I have done learning about classification models in Python.
In this repository, I show my understanding of using classification models such as Linear Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees.
I cover simple DataSets, showing the accuracy of my models and how I made them better.
This repository also shows my knowledge in creating visualizations in Python.


Project 1 - Decision Trees.ipynb
In this project, I use decision trees on a drug dataset to predict which conditions the specified drug should be used
