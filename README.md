# Data Science
Data Science-Projects:

This repository is mainly for projects I have done learning about classicafaction moderls in Python.
In this repository i show my understanding of using classifaction models such as Linear Regression , SVM an Decsison Trees.
I coversimple DataSets, showing thre accuracy of my models and how i made them better


Part 1 - Intro to Data Analysis
Subjects Covered:

Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application
Data Analysis Process
NumPy for 1 and 2D Data
Pandas Series and Dataframes
Project 1: Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report. In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings.

Project 2: Data Analysis with No-show Movie appointments
Project 3: Data Analysis with-ncis-and-census-data
Part 2 -Practical Statistics
